Hi there, this is a fun python pygame project to visualize A* path finding Algorithm.
I will kfurther add different path finding algorithms, but for starters,we will begin with A* Path Finding Algorithm.
To get started,make sure that you have python installed in your pc.
Python 3.7 or above just do the thing.
Now then, check you have latest version of pip install.
pip is a a default package manager for Python package.By default,it is already installed with Python package.
To check pip version,open your command prompt and hit and enter: pip --version
To install its latest version, hit and enter: python -m pip install -upgrade pip
to install pygame,hit and enter: pip install pygame
You are all set to write your code.Choose any code editor of your choice.
Check the source code from: project0.py
After comlition of code,execute it.
Set initial node(start) and final node(end) and draw the boulders between the path.
To start the visualization,press: F5 + Space(tab) buttons
to re-enter the nodes,press : F5 + c
